		  		<h2>About Me</h2>
		   			<p>
			  			Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Rudy</strong>, a self-taught artist and video game enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I am a digital-focused artist who specializes in 2D art and animation, though my areas of interest also include programming and 3D modeling. My fascination with all things video games has led me to becoming a student at the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, where I am currently studying game design.
		    		</p>
		  		<h2>Future Work</h2>
		    		<p>
			  			With the experience I gain in the coming years, I hope to prosper as an <strong>independent game developer</strong>, working as a programmer, artist, and designer. I am currently developing my own independent game project with the intent to self-publish. However, I am always open to working within the industry as a specialized artist.
